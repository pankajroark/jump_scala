Implement a basic parser that provides a list of symbols
Add an api that adds a path to include
  - We'll find the git root of the path and add that to our list

G-i-t- -R-o-o-t- -t-r-a-c-k-e-r- -w-i-l-l- -k-e-e-p- -t-r-a-c-k- -o-f- -g-i-t- -r-o-o-t-s
This would also need to go into a table.

Implement table connection manager.
Implement table creation code.


Implement DiskCrawler that goes over each path under the git roots and gets the mod stamp of each file and inserts in the table
Implement DirtFinder that finds the modified files and puts them on the dirt queue.
  DirtFinder just goes through the file table and finds the files that have a mod stamp higher than the process time and inserts them into the process queue.
  How do we make sure that DF does queue same files again and again
  When we process the file we'll update the process time of the file, before we parse the file we'll check the modstamp of the file again to avoid unnecessary work.

More unit tests for everything
Think of how to how to reduce db size. focus on the symbol table.
  - Instead of file path we could store id of the corresponding entry in file table.
    - Modify the file table to also store an id and create an index on the id
    - Implement JSymbolShort to only store file id
    - Choose the symbol and then expand the file id at the end.
    - Actually write unit tests first to avoid breaking

Add an end point for marking a file dirty directly. On the vim side call
  this api whenever a file is saved. Perhaps also when it's opened. We'll
  verify the timestamps anyway so won't cost much.

Think of dot chained symbol lookup.
Add end point for deleting a git root


Unit Tests
 - For renamed import
 - For exact match
 - For prefix match

Support a way of listing the closest matches
