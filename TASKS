Implement a basic parser that provides a list of symbols
Add an api that adds a path to include
  - We'll find the git root of the path and add that to our list

Git Root tracker will keep track of git roots
This would also need to go into a table.

Implement DiskCrawler that goes over each path under the git roots and gets the mod stamp of each file and inserts in the table
Implement DirtFinder that finds the modified files and puts them on the dirt queue.
  DirtFinder just goes through the file table and finds the files that have a mod stamp higher than the process time and inserts them into the process queue.
  How do we make sure that DF does queue same files again and again
  When we process the file we'll update the process time of the file, before we parse the file we'll check the modstamp of the file again to avoid unnecessary work.

Implement ParseWorker that reads dirty files off the dirtqueue, parses the files and inserts the symbols into the symbol table.
